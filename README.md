# Goal: Generate random number

Have you ever played a game with your friends where you ask them to Pick a number between some range of numbers like: "Pick a number between 1 and 10"? Their job is to make a guess, and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what you've told them. If they guess the right answer the game is done. Normally you try to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. Often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses.

Build a console number guessing game that prompts a player to choose a number between a specified range of numbers. After the user guesses the correct number, display the number of attempts it took them to guess correctly.

**How the program works**
* Made sure the script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
* As a player of the game, they should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.
* As a player of the game, they should be continuously prompted for a guess until they get it right.
* As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess they should be told if their answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that they can narrow down their guesses.
* As a player of the game, after the game ends they should be shown their number of attempts at guessing.

# Instructions for coin_toss_experiment.py

# Goal: Simulate a Coin Toss Experiment

Suppose you flip a fair coin repeatedly until it lands on both heads and tails at least once each. In other words, after the first flip, you continue to flip the coin until it lands on something different.

Doing this generates a sequence of heads and tails. For example, the first time you dd this experiement, the sequence might be heads, heads, then tails.

On avarage, how many flips are needed for the sequence to contain both heads and tails?

Write a simulation that runs 10,000 trials of the experiment and prints the average number of flips per trial.
