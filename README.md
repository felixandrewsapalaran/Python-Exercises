# Problem Num: 2

# Goal: Simulate a Coin Toss Experiment

Instructions for coin_toss_experiment.py

Suppose you flip a fair coin repeatedly until it lands on both heads and tails at least once each. In other words, after the first flip, you continue to flip the coin until it lands on something different.

Doing this generates a sequence of heads and tails. For example, the first time you dd this experiement, the sequence might be heads, heads, then tails.

On avarage, how many flips are needed for the sequence to contain both heads and tails?

Write a simulation that runs 10,000 trials of the experiment and prints the average number of flips per trial.

# Problem Num: 3

# Goal: Simulate an Election

Instruction: With some help from the random module and a little condition logic, you can simulate an election between two candidates.

Suppose two candidates: Candidate A and Candiadate B, are running for mayor in a city with three voting regions. The most recent polls show that Candidate A has the following chances for winning in each region:

                Region 1: 87% chance of winning
                Region 2: 65% chance of winning
                Region 3: 17% chance of winning
Write a program that simulates the election 10,000 times and prints the percentage of where Candidate A wins.

To keep things simple, assume that candidate wins the electioon is they win in at least two of the three regions.

# Problem Num: 4

# Goal: List of List

Instruction: Write a program that contains the following lists of lists:

universities = [
    ['California Institute of Technology', 2175, 37704],
    ['Harvard', 19627, 39849],
    ['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 10566, 40732],
    ['Princeton', 7802, 37000],
    ['Rice', 5879, 35551],
    ['Stanford', 19535, 40569],
    ['Yale', 11701, 40500]
]

Define a function, enrollment_stats(), that takes, as an input, a list of list where each individual list contains 
three elements: 

(a)the name of a university
(b) the total number of enrolled studets
(c) the annual tuition fees.

enrollment_stats() should return two lists: 
1. the first containing all of the student enrollment values
2. the second containing all of the tuition fees

Next, define a mean() and a median() function. Both functions should take a single list as an argument and return 
the mean and median of the values in each list.

Using universities, enrollment_stats(), mean(), and median(), calculate the total number of students, the total tuition,
the mean and median of the number of students, and the mean and median tuition values.

Finally, output all values, and format the output so that it looks like this:

******************************
Total students:   77,285
Total tuition:  $ 271,905

Student mean:     11,040.71
Student median:   10,566

Tuition mean:   $ 38,843.57
Tuition median: $ 39,849
******************************

# Problem Num: 5

# Goal: Cats With Hats

Instruction: You have 100 cats

One day you decide to arrange all your cats in a giant circle. Initially, none of your cats have any hats on. 
You walk around the circle 100 times, always starting at the same spo, with the first cat üêà  (cat #1). Every
time you stop at a cat, you either put a hat on it if it doesn't have one on, or you take its hat off if it has 
one on. 

1. The first round, you stop at every cat, placing a hat on each one.
2. The second round, you only stop at every second cat (#2, #4, #6, #8, etc.)
3. The third round, you only stop at every third cat (#3, #6, #9, #12, etc.)
4. You continue this process until you've made 100 rounds around the cats (e.g., you only visits the 100th cat).

Write a program that simply outputs which cats have hats at the end.

# Problem Num: 7

# Goal: Counting Frequncies in a list

Instuction: In this program, we have an array of elements to count 
the occurrence of its each element. One of the approaches 
to resolve this problem is to maintain one array to store the 
counts of each element of the array. Loop through the array and 
count the occurrence of each element as frequency and store it in 
another array

Input : [1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1,
                  4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output : 1 : 5
         2 : 4
         3 : 3
         4 : 3
         5 : 2

# Problem Num: 8

# Goal: Calculating the total number of bytes to store

If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up 4097 bytes will use 4096 * 2 = 8192 bytes of storage. Create a function called calculate_storage  which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size.

1 file should have a total of 4096 of bytes in order to store this file
4096 file should have a total of 4096 of bytes in order to store this file
4097 file should have a total of 8192 of bytes in order to store this file
6000 file should have a total of 8192 of bytes in order to store this file
